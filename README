We didn't have any problematic issues in Phase C or D, but we did make some slight modifications/advancements since Phase D. Our queries in Phase D mainly focused on answering specific, fixed question, but for Phase E we transformed many of them to accomodate user input and interaction. In addition, since we wrote 17 different queries in Phase D, we chose to only implement 15 of them
